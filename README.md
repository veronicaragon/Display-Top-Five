# Top Five Salespersons Lab 5️⃣👥

This lab implements an algorithm to determine the top five salespersons using an array in JavaScript. The algorithm sorts salespersons based on their total sales and displays the top five in descending order.

## Introduction ✍️ 

Some algorithms utilize data structures to store and organize data during the algorithm execution. In this lab, we implement an algorithm that determines the top five salespersons using an array. The array is sorted from highest total sales to lowest total sales.

## Implementation ⚙️ 

The implementation consists of two main functions:

1. `SortDescending(array)`: A function to sort an array of objects in descending order based on a specified property.

2. `DisplayTopFiveSalespersons(allSalespersons)`: The main function that determines the top five salespersons from the provided array of salespersons and displays the result.

## Usage 🤖 

1. **SortDescending(array):**
   - Input: An array of objects with a numeric property to sort.
   - Output: The same array sorted in descending order.

2. **DisplayTopFiveSalespersons(allSalespersons):**
   - Input: An array of salespersons, each with properties `name` and `salesTotal`.
   - Output: Display the top five salespersons in the console.
